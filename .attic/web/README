This folder contains the python code that realizes my website. Managing third-party dependencies was
getting more and more painful, so I moved to using virtualenv. The flip side of the idea is that the
code checked out of git isn't ready for use. I need to recreate the environment again. This note (to
myself) is a list of steps for recreating the workspace for a fresh checkout.

- virtualenv --distribute WEB (using a name other than "WEB" will require changes to ".gitignore")
- source WEB/bin/activate
- pip install webob
- pip install Paste
- pip install webapp2
- pip install Jinja2
- pip install GitPython
- pip install BeautifulSoup4
- ln -s WEB/<lib>/site-packages ajdweb/dynamic/lib (or Junction)
- Edit ajdweb/dynamic/test/__init__.py and point it to where you have the GAE SDK installed.
- python -m unittest dynamic.test.smoke.SmokeTest

If the SmokeTest runs fine, you're all set.

A Self Portrait

This page describes this page.

<img class="pull-right img-polaroid" src="assets/img/hand-reflecting-sphere.jpg">

This page, like all other pages on this website, started its life as a [markdown][markdown] text
buffer in [emacs][emacs]. It was then checked into my [web content][content] git repo. There it
[lived][file], through revisions, till I finished tweaking it and was reasonably comfortable with
you seeing it. Then, I triggered my Google App Engine [web application][webpy] to synchronize itself
with my web content repo.

The trigger was an empty HTTP POST on an authenticated URL[<sup>#</sup>][sync]. The POST request
handler used the [Github API][github] to figure what exactly changed (since the last trigger) and
made similar changes to the application datastore. The [datastore][gaepy] held the raw markdown
content of this page along with some meta data (things like title, date, etc.) for future
reference. There, these lived, till you pointed your browser to this page.

When you pointed your browser to this page, it sent a request to the [Github Pages][gpage] web
server. The server hosts only one static HTML page. So, regardless of what page your browser asked
for, the web server would have returned the same [index][index] page. That page, however, referred
to a bunch of other [assets][assets], one of which was a [script][ajdjs] that contained an
[Ember.js][ember] application. The Ember application used a [router][embrout] to detect the
identifier of this page from the URL (the bit after the `/#/`) and then used it to make a few
[CORS][cors] Ajax queries back into to the GAE datastore using the [Ember Data][emberdata] REST
adapter. The response ([1][getp], [2][page]) of these queries was mapped to the Ember data models
and triggered the controllers to update the [handlebar][handle] placeholders in the static
HTML. Finally, the raw markdown content received was translated to HTML using [markedjs][marked] and
[highlightjs][hljs]. And that's about it.

This page _actually_ started off as a 'credits' page where I wanted to list the components that make
up this website. The description above does that for most of the major bits, but there are a few
others. In particular, the pages use Twitter [Bootstrap][bootstrap] for visual styling and the
responsive grids, the icons, however, are from [Font Awesome][font]. The test version of the stack
runs over a local git repo with Redis as the [datastore][redpy] (using [redis-py][redispy].) I use
[Travis][travis] as my [backend CI][ci] system.

Finally, I must admit, most of the implementation choices made here were made because I wanted to
educate myself on a few _trending_ web technologies. Actually, quite a few of these are not the best
choices given the static nature of the content. Moreover, there are plenty of gaps and rough edges
that need grinding. But then, what on earth is ever finished.
